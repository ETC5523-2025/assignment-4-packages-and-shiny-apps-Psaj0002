Description: 
    This package provides a simulated dataset and interactive Shiny application 
    for exploring COVID-19 outbreak dynamics under different public-health conditions. 
    The dataset 'covid_data' contains information on vaccination rates, vaccine efficacy, 
    testing frequency, variant transmissibility (R0), and outbreak risk. 
    The accompanying Shiny app, which can be launched with `run_app()`, allows users to visualize 
    how these factors interact to influence the likelihood of outbreaks for different 
    variants.
