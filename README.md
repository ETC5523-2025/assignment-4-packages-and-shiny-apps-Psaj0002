## Overview

`CovidDataPackage1` helps users understand how public-health factors influence the probability of a COVID-19 outbreak.  
The package includes:

- **A dataset** (`covid_data`) containing simulated outbreak-related variables.  
- **An interactive Shiny app** (`run_app()`) that visualizes how these factors interact across different variants.  
- **A vignette** (`COVID_Quarantine`) explaining how to use the dataset and app together.

The package demonstrates how R packages can integrate data, analysis, and interactivity for reproducible public-health modelling.
